  <p>The revised schedule itemises the remaining Premiums that you (the Borrower) must pay to the Government each quarter for the remaining duration of your loan. It has been prepared to reflect the changes to your loan that you recently agreed with your Lender. Your premium collection cycle remains unchanged so the first premium listed on this schedule is due at your next collection point. You only need to complete a new Direct Debit Mandate if you have either: moved your loan to a different lender, or changed the bank account from which future Premiums are to be collected.</p>

  <p>This Schedule itemises the cost of the Premiums that you (the Borrower) will be paying to the Government each quarter for the duration of this loan. The first Direct Debit payment is due shortly after the loan is drawn down. Future payments are collected quarterly, with collection being made on or around the 14th of the month.</p>

  <p>You must include a completed Direct Debit Mandate when you accept the loan you have been offered.</p>
